No
But I mean like, we lose net neutrality, it's just another thing that is controlled by the giant corporations
They only care about making profits at the expense of high traffic sites and consumers

The draft: all men must sign up for the draft within 30 days of their 18th birthday in either direction. Failing to do so before your 26th birthday will stop you from working in the postal service or ANY executive branch position, as well as up to a quarter of a million dollar fine and up to 5 years on prison. It is a felony that stops you from receiving pretty much any federal money.
This is just ridiculous.
There hasn't been a draft since 1973, but it could theoretically happen at any time, and seeing as the US hasn't officially declared war since WWII
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:44
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
It's for like if WW3 happened
And you could always sign up for the Coast guard
Jacob • 16 Jul, 23:45
Ted Lastname
Here's the super bullshit part: women do **not** have to sign up, despite the law from 2015 that states that women are equal in the military
They passed a law that says women are as good as men, but didn't force them to enter the draft
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:47
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Then we'll change it
Jacob • 16 Jul, 23:47
Ted Lastname
We most certainly won't
If anything is going to happen, I will which nothing ever will, it will be abolished entirely
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:48
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
I don't think it'll be abolished
Anyways, apparently my mom got security cameras IN the house
Jacob • 16 Jul, 23:48
Ted Lastname
We don't need a draft for WWIII, we saw in WWII that people basically begged to join the military, and I'm sure it'll happen again
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:48
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
We still called on the draft for WW2
Jacob • 16 Jul, 23:49
Ted Lastname
It should be abolished, forcing people into combat is unacceptable.
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:49
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
But I don't know if IN means inside the house facing outside or inside the house facing INside

Ted • 16 Jul, 23:53

Now if it's nuclear war, it is which is the most likely, adding four million people doesn't add any value
You need like seven guys in a bunker in Montana to press the go button
Ted • 16 Jul, 23:54
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
But at also have a lot of things for the nukes too
Anti-missile equipment, planes with heartseeking flares, etc.
Jacob • 16 Jul, 23:55

I don't think that we'd be in need of enough people to warrant a draft

read Ishmael by Daniel Quinn it deals with this precisely

also Ted: is the video you sent supposed to represent socialism?

Ted Lastname
He’s sharing and not keeping all of the bread to himself
Ted • 17 Jul, 16:58
Beau Berg (oreioscookies@gmail.com)
there's no third party interference, which leads me to believe it's more representative of an ideal capitalist society
I don't think you understand socialism
If the video were representative of socialism, someone else would have taken part of the bread and given it away
It's not voluntary
Beau • 17 Jul, 16:59

Ya know what, I don’t think that exists as a video
I’m sorry

Oh yeah
But it still was during a 'war'
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:08
Ted Lastname
But not during a declared war. Basically in a legal sense a draft was declared outside of war, and could be even if we aren’t really in a major combat non-war
I think this isn’t okay either

Ted • 17 Jul, 19:12
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
But let's get onto the topic of tipping
Why
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:12

Bullshit, the employers should pay their workers a living wage, #fightforfifteen
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:13
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
It's pretty high risk
15 is stupidly high
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:13
Ted Lastname
False
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:13
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
True
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:13
Ted Lastname
10.10 is still below poverty line

40 hours for 52 weeks


Ted • 17 Jul, 19:22
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
That's above the poverty line
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:22
Ted Lastname

Most people don’t work that much, and I don’t think it includes taxes
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:23
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
The poverty line includes pre tax salary
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:23
Ted Lastname
Not that chart, those are after tax
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:24
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Okay
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:25
Ted Lastname
Plus a lot of single mothers will have one or two kids, and have a minimum wage job, so a $15 an hour wage puts them above it.
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:26
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
That's what welfare is for, without the risk of inflation
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:28
Ted Lastname
Welfare is not for that at all
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:28
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Food stamps, schooling, housing, it takes care a lot of the expenses
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:28
Ted Lastname
It’s meant to be a temporary income for unemployed people so they can survive and get employed
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:29
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
I mean welfare programs
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:29
Ted Lastname
You shouldn’t need to have a job *and* welfae
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:29
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
I mixed the two up
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:30
Ted Lastname
Still
You should only need one job to support you
Not two + welfare
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:32
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Minimum wage should support one adult
Which should be bracketed by age
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:33
Ted Lastname
And currently, it barely puts one adult above the poverty line, which isn’t really “supporting”
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:34
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
For below 18 I think current min. wage is enough though
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:35
Ted Lastname
There’s all sorts of studies that show that people who have lower incomes have a significantly harder time getting up
What do you mean below 18
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:35
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Below age 18
Jacob • 17 Jul, 19:38
Ted Lastname
Hold on, there’s a some statistics I wanna double check
It’s an info graphic and I swear it’s worth it

So there it is: 88% are not teens
Not raising the minimum wage because 12% don’t need it doesn’t make sense
Ted • 17 Jul, 19:53
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
If you would be read what I said, it should be bracketed
So those under 18 make $7.25/hr
Jacob • 17 Jul, 20:09
Ted Lastname
I did read it, you just didn’t say how much it should go up by

Yeah lol I actually thought about that so and then decided against it
t • 24 Jul, 22:08

I think it’s be better if you ask one of her friends what you should say, then she’ll *immediately* tell Miranda
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:09

Hmmmm. Cuz also she sent me a low lighting smile picture that was like directed right at the camera but what is she sent that to all of her streaks, not just me

Cuz I'm sorta not about that life... (dating)

Cuz when it's past my bed time I get emotionally confused

Well, you’re tired, people do funny stuff when they’re tired, but still. I can’t speak for you but I only send personal stuff if I think it really matters. My cat died about a month ago and I didn’t say anything.

Her mouth?!?!? Send pics
t • 24 Jul, 22:17
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
So it seems you like less traditionally beautiful, but still cute in their own ways girls
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:17
John Gleboff (jgleboff@gmail.com)
She's not animated so Jacob dislikes her
John • 24 Jul, 22:17

Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Although my standards of beauty have been raised to such a point and combined with my relentless perfectionism and little bit of inferiority complex will make it very difficult to accept myself and others as attractive
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:19

Ted • 24 Jul, 22:19

Oops by Travis I meant john

Ted • 24 Jul, 22:21
t iervolino
Robots?
t • 24 Jul, 22:21
Ted Lastname
This has gone too far already
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:21
t iervolino
Cats?
t • 24 Jul, 22:21
Ted Lastname
Yes
Robots, not cats
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:21
t iervolino
Robot cats?
t • 24 Jul, 22:21
Ted Lastname
But no to any
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:21
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
No it's just something I figured while looking into myself
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:22
Ted Lastname
Jaws and cheekbones. Short brown hair. If you must know.
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:22
t iervolino
But come on there has to be someone you find attractive... Like a celebrity or somebody
t • 24 Jul, 22:22
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Also I've decided to make a real Girlfriend Bot 2500

YES
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:22
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)

t iervolino
Your type is John?
t • 24 Jul, 22:23
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Which will have an optional girlfriend mode for gags
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:23
Ted Lastname
Ladies only
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:23
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
Otherwise it'll be a simple daily assistant
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:23
t iervolino
Lol but come on he does fit your description... you never know until you try....
t • 24 Jul, 22:23
Ted Lastname
I don’t know if many celebrities, so I don’t know if there’s one
And no
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:24
t iervolino
Ok suit yourself
t • 24 Jul, 22:24

t • 24 Jul, 22:24
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)

t • 24 Jul, 22:26
Ted Lastname
Hold on
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:26
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
When Ted started dating Indie sent his GFs IG
So I wouldn't say
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:26
t iervolino
So ok I guess
t • 24 Jul, 22:27
John Gleboff (jgleboff@gmail.com)
Snapchat would be creepy
John • 24 Jul, 22:27
t iervolino
But it won't really make a difference I. This convo
And yeah it would be jogny
John
t • 24 Jul, 22:27
Ted Lastname
This whole conversation has become morally iffy
So go ahead
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:28
t iervolino
I agree. Hmm one moment
t • 24 Jul, 22:28
Ted Lastname
I looked at your IG to see her in your band pic, but there’s too many names, I’m not sure who hers is pointing to

t • 24 Jul, 22:32
Ted Lastname
Hmm
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:33
John Gleboff (jgleboff@gmail.com)

Ted • 24 Jul, 22:37
t iervolino
No no no ok
Second row
Four th from the left
t • 24 Jul, 22:38
Ted Lastname
First standing row?
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:38
t iervolino
Yeah
Thoughts?
t • 24 Jul, 22:39
Ted Lastname
I’m still not sure I’m looking at the right one
Hold on
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:39

Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:45

I don’t know
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:46

t • 24 Jul, 22:46
Ted Lastname
?? ????
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:46
t iervolino
That's why all of this is even a moral issue
I feel bad about liking a girl just b.c. of her looks
But also those looks are really good
t • 24 Jul, 22:47
Ted Lastname
You’re a teenager
Whatever
Our hormones are screaming **FUCK** at the top of their lungs
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:47

Ted • 24 Jul, 22:49
t iervolino
Ewww! Personal contact!
t • 24 Jul, 22:49
Ted Lastname
But like, low pressure
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:49
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
That's totally normal
I believe there are 3 levels of attraction for a successful relationship
1. Physical, what draws you to them in the first place
2. Personality, if you can stand being by them
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:49
t iervolino
But I feel safer Hiding behind a wall of virtuality
t • 24 Jul, 22:49
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
3. Pheromones, i.e. first kiss, and whether or not your body accepts it
Jacob • 24 Jul, 22:49
Ted Lastname
No
Hiding is bad
Suck it up candyass
Just do the thing
Ted • 24 Jul, 22:50
t iervolino
Ok lol I'll see if I have any balls tomorrow and make a move
t • 24 Jul, 22:50

No, not see if you have the balls, so it
Definitely tomorrow though
100% creepy in the middle of the night

Here's how to get a girl @theo
Make her come to your house
Have shrimps and prime rib prepared
Sensually eat it and take her to the bedroom
You can make love on the top of ur bunk bed ;)
Or alternatively ask her to like Mile of music or something
And start a streak with her

theo, this is how you get a girl - snapchat her less but get her # and start texting her. be really smooth w top notch references and normie memes. then after 3 weeks invite her out to do something with two of your friends so theres no pressure bc its a group thing but then your two friends will abandon you leaving you with her. have a great time. repeat process in a couple of weeks, two to three times (ex. mile of music, parties, etc). talk more & text & maybe videochat but thats corny. plan something to do by yourselves (ex. movie, funset, go get coffee downtown, lunch, walk in a park). boom u have a girl

In 1936, FDR won 60.8% of the popular vote, and 98.5% of the electoral college. This is why we need to remove it, at best it’s misrepresentative, at worst it gives the wrong result.

Among many other reasons
Reagan had similar results, except he only got around 51% for popular but won all but Minnesota and DC

Weed is way worse
It's like smoking and alcohol, but more like sleep medicine

not that I know of, but I could be wrong

My family makes the powder ice tea, I don’t like it because it’s too sour/bitter (I’m not sure which)
I have a hard time telling the difference

I brew my own iced tea
Jacob • 29 Jul, 18:27
Ted Lastname
I don’t understand hot drinks with ice in them, I don’t think that the watering down is worth the little bit of coldness that you get. Plus I don’t like drinking things with ice in them, I usually find the ice annoying
Ted • 29 Jul, 18:32
Jacob Ortiz Breiting (JacOB) (jacob-mob@hotmail.com, jacobmob2001@gmail.com)
I usually steep some black tea and put it in the fridge, and later add simple syrup if I want sweet sea
For green teas I flavor with honey and lemon

I’m pretty sure YouTube has some control over it, so they’re probably putting those up to the top because the products they’re sponsoring in those videos get promoted as well
YouTube doesn’t give a shit about any of its producers, just that sweet sweet ad money
It’s for sure they have influence, this chips ahoy video with 1.3M is higher up than MatttBRapper, which his fans are called the BFamily in the description

No, when I was young I couldn’t breathe well after even a little exercise, and they said it was asthma. Now I’m older and go on super long bike rides and have no problems. 
I was just fat.
I was around 150 lbs sometime in like sixth grade or so (if I’m remembering right) and I don’t think I was even five feet tall. Now I’m 6 foot and 175, so I’m still in the “overweight” category but not by much

If we shrink me an inch and add 5 pounds I’m just barely in the overweight category


More like rounding than shrinking and adding
I measured 180 this week, but I’ve been at my grandmothers for a week and at my other grandmothers the week before, so that’ll add a lot

I gotta say though, there are two real tricks to not being fat
1) genetics, this can mean naturally healthy all the time, or like me where you gain height but not weight during puberty
2) just not eating stuff when you’re not hungry. In my family it can be hard, I don’t really like getting presents and that sort of thing as much as most people, but I like food; this causes my grandparents and mother to want me to eat more because they feel bad that I don’t like the stuff I get as much as they would
I’m not super healthy, I don’t get really any form of exercise regularly, but I’ll take unfit over overweight or obese
Now the real test is staying healthy, pretty much everyone in my family is at least a little overweight, and I’ve never really had the healthiest of habits in terms of eating and nutrition.
In other (though a little related) news, I’ll be doing bike to the beat in a few days, which is a bike ride with mile of music. There are stops with bands playing and food along the way. I’ll be doing at least the 36 mike version, there’s a 50 mile that I might try if I feel up to it on the day

About the asthma thing. Also 36 miles on a bike is crazy but nice job

Thanks, I did it before on the Elroy-Sparta trail with the tunnels, so I know I can do at least that, which is why I’m considering the 50
It’s all in or near the city, so worst case scenario I have my mom or dad come pick me up, she’ll be doing the 10 I think and my dad won’t be doing it at all
Here’s a trail I’m going to do sometime, it’s about 50 miles as well:

That trail is the paper trail, it just opened in June
The bike to the beat is an organised ride
Ted • 30 Jul, 16:25
Gabe Smith (abigailnoah2001@gmail.com)
I would do the paper trail with you sometime it ya want
Gabe • 30 Jul, 16:25
Ted Lastname
I’d like that, riding alone can be boring even with music and podcasts
Be warned though, it’ll be over 3 hours if we average 15mph, and over 4 at 12
Of course 5 at 10
Ted • 30 Jul, 16:30

Plus I haven’t had a day with my mother since the 15th, and that was wedding day so we didn’t get to talk as much as we normally would, so probably sometime after the 5th

Jacob • 30 Jul, 16:58

I’d be fine, but she’s pretty bummed, plus we have to move our cat in to the house, which already has two cats
She’s been doing that with only my step-dad and her for the past week
I don’t know about congrats, it’s not like I think I won’t like it, but I don’t really get excited and it doesn’t really change much other than my moms name, the house, and the whole step- thing

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Fun fact: in December of the year 292,277,026,596 64 bit computers will break, and the time will display 1 January 1970.
This will happen to 32 bit computers in 28 years.
Ted • 30 Jul, 20:18
Ndemazea Fonkem
r/todayilearned
Ndemazea • 30 Jul, 21:04
Ted Lastname
It’s Y292277026K
Correction: with 32 bit it will roll over and display 1 jan 1970 in 2106, but clock will cease to work in 2038 because it’ll keep adding and in computers the first bit is positive(0)/negative(1) and it’ll display December of 1901
So like in 8bit you’d have 00011001 meaning 25, and 11010001 meaning -81
except when you get to 64 and 32 bit it’s not as simple as that, you have the +/-, then at the end there some number (iirc 11) digits that is for scientific notation (but with 2^ instead of 10^) and then the others in the middle are considered to come after 1. in scientific notation.
Im sure you can find better explanation of this on the internet,
If you go on YouTube I know there a video called computer number line or something like that
